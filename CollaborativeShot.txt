I will start creating this
You can join whenever you feel fits
Let's see how this thing unfolds
And learn to use Git once and for all

Starting was a good idea,
Now that gits becoming clear.
There was a huge list of commands here,
but now I see there's nothing to fear.

CONFLICT TEST

This tripped my git out I am scared
Saving lines is a big deal, dear.
Just learnt another big command
And might use it all the time.
